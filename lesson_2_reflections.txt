What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You initialize a repository by using: git initialize
This creates a .git folder that keeps data about the versions.
A new repository doesn't have commits. You can use: git starus to 
see the files in the repository. They will be untracked because you 
haven't made any commits yet.
